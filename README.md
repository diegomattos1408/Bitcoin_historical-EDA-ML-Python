# Predictive Modeling of Bitcoin Prices with LSTM
This project leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict Bitcoin prices. By applying deep learning techniques, we aim to provide valuable insights for investors, financial analysts, and cryptocurrency enthusiasts.

# Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization of trends, patterns, and outliers in the historical data of Bitcoin.
- Data Preparation: Cleaning and normalization of data for model training.
- LSTM Modeling: Construction and training of an LSTM model for price prediction.
- Model Evaluation: Performance metrics including MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ².
- Overfitting Solutions: Implementation of techniques such as L2 regularization and Dropout to improve model generalization.
